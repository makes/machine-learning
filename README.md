# Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications (TX00DV62)

Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications is a freely selectable course in Bachelor of Information Technology Degree Programme students at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The following three case studies were completed during the course.

Case 1 - [Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Case%201%20-%20Heart%20Disease%20Classification.ipynb)
-------------------------------------

In this exercise we create an ANN to classify UCI Heart Disease -dataset.

Score: 14/15

Case 2 - [Pneumonia](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Case%202%20-%20Pneumonia.ipynb)
------------------

In this exercise we create CNN models to classify pneumonia in chest x-ray images.

Score: 19/20

Case 3 - [Drug Reviews](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Case%203%20-%20Drug%20Reviews.ipynb)
---------------------

In this exercise we build a model to predict numerical ratings from textual drug reviews written by patients. This is done using text processing and a 1D CNN.

Score: 15/15

# Mathematics and Methods in Machine Learning and Neural Networks (TX00DV61)

Methods 1 - [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%201%20-%20Data%20Manipulation.ipynb)
-----------------------------

The aim of this exercise was to verify Anaconda3 software installation, create a Jupyter notebook and see that everything is running properly. Next, we try creating a pandas dataframe and get statistics from it, load data from a `.csv` file, iterate through rows and visualize a correlation matrix.

Methods 2 - [Clustering Algorithms](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%202%20-%20Clustering.ipynb)
---------------------------------

In this exercise, we determine depot locations for a drone delivery system based on spatial data, using K-means clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

Methods 3 - [Decision Trees](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%203%20-%20Decision%20Trees.ipynb)
--------------------------

The aim of this exercise it to create a useful decision tree, visualize it and provide an accuracy estimate for it.

Methods 4 - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%204%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
-----------------------------

In this assignment, we learned how to conduct linear regression analysis with some feature engineering and awareness of the assumptions of linear regression.

Methods 5 - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%205%20-%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
-------------------------------

Using logistic regression to tackle a classification problem. Analyzing the predicrive quality of the model.

Methods 6 - [Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%206%20-%20Recommendation%20Engine.ipynb)
---------------------------------

The aim of this exercise is to create a recommendation engine. The methods used and compared are [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) and [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition).

We learn how to deal with algorithms requiring excessive hardware resources.

Methods 7 - [Text Analytics](https://github.com/makes/machine-learning/blob/master/Methods%207%20-%20Text%20Analytics.ipynb)
--------------------------

In this exercise, we do a simple dictionary-based tone analysis and learn about natural language processing methods using `nltk`.

We visualize how the tone of the text develops between positive and negative.
