# Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications (TX00DV62)

Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications is a freely selectable course in Bachelor of Information Technology Degree Programme students at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The following three case studies were completed during the course.

Case 1 - Heart Disease Classification
-------------------------------------

In this exercise we create an ANN to classify UCI Heart Disease -dataset.

Score: 14/15

Case 2 - Pneumonia
------------------

In this exercise we create CNN models to classify pneumonia in chest x-ray images.

Score: 19/20

Case 3 - Drug Reviews
---------------------

In this exercise we build a model to predict numerical ratings from textual drug reviews written by patients. This is done using text processing and a 1D CNN.

Score: 15/15

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Mathematics and Methods in Machine Learning and Neural Networks (TX00DV61)

Methods 1 - Data Manipulation
-----------------------------

The aim of this exercise was to verify Anaconda3 software installation, create a Jupyter notebook and see that everything is running properly. Next, we try creating a pandas dataframe and get statistics from it, load data from a `.csv` file, iterate through rows and visualize a correlation matrix.

Methods 2 - Clustering Algorithms
---------------------------------

In this exercise, we determine depot locations for a drone delivery system based on spatial data, using K-means clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

Methods 3 - Decision Trees
--------------------------

The aim of this exercise it to create a useful decision tree, visualize it and provide an accuracy estimate for it.

Methods 4 - Linear Regression
-----------------------------

In this assignment, we learned how to conduct linear regression analysis with some feature engineering and awareness of the assumptions of linear regression.

Methods 5 - Logistic Regression
-------------------------------

Using logistic regression to tackle a classification problem. Analyzing the predicrive quality of the model.

Methods 6 - Recommendation Engine
---------------------------------

The aim of this exercise is to create a recommendation engine. The methods used and compared are [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) and [Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition).

We learn how to deal with algorithms requiring excessive hardware resources.

Methods 7 - Text Analytics
--------------------------

In this exercise, we do a simple dictionary-based tone analysis and learn about natural language processing methods using `nltk`.

We visualize how the tone of the text develops between positive and negative.
